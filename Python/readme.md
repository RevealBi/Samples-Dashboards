# Using Python in Reveal

Creating Python visualizations is a fun and simple way to extend the data visualization options you have in Reveal.

To get started, make sure you have read the [pre-requisites](https://github.com/RevealBi/Samples-Dashboards/blob/master/Python/installing-python.md) guide and have Python installed and operational.



Connect to your data source as if you were using a built in Reveal Chart and drag / drop the fields you require for your visualization
Select Python from the Change Visualization dropdown
Switch the Settings Tab, click the Edit Script button
Note the Libraries and Fields that are available by default
Your data is referenced in the data object
By default, Python with Matplotlib renders as an Image in the Reveal Visualization canvas
Apply a Data Filter
All Settings, Filters, etc in Reveal work across any custom visualization
